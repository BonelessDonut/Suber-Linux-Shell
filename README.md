# Suber Shell
## Overview
A simple shell I created using C and foundational Linux utilities, modeled after Bash.
### Some features include:
- Running programs and commands via fork and exec
- Input or output redirection with truncating or appending (<, >, >>)
- Pipes to connect multiple programs together

## How to run
You can compile the suber.c source file using gcc or whatever your favorite C compiler is, and it should be able to start running the shell with the executable.
